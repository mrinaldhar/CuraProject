<h2>Krishna's flash stuff and the "SUBJECT" list of posts also goes along on this page!</h2>
<br /><br />
Original index file(you need it for the timer) is at ./index2.php
<br /><br />I thought that people should be introduced to meny on this page. 
<br /><br />
I have made considerable progress in the admin page and backend. I will continue work on that. <br />
Meanwhile, I have pushed the backend files to github too. But, they wont work because a critical file(with details of my server username and password) has not been pushed.
<br />I can show the work to you on my laptop.<br /><br />
